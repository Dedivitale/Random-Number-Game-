This is a simple Python game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. The game provides hints after each guess, telling the player if their guess is too high or too low. The goal is to find the correct number in as few attempts as possible.
To run the game, make sure you have Python installed. Save the code in a file (whatheweryouwant.py) and run it using the command python whatheweryouwant.py. Follow the on-screen instructions to play.
The game is a great way to learn basic Python concepts like loops, conditionals, and user input. Itâ€™s simple, fun, and perfect for beginners.
